# VFang — Razer Blade Control Center for Linux

**Control your Razer Blade without Windows.**

VFang is a free, open-source Linux app for performance modes, fan curves,
battery charging, keyboard lighting, GPU switching, displays, and live
temperatures.

VFang preserves the `fang` and `fangd` commands and packages, plus the existing
service, group, socket, and configuration identifiers for compatibility.

## Install — one command

> ### Copy. Paste. Done.
>
> Open **Terminal**, paste this one line, and press **Enter**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/bladeandsoulx/vfang-razer-linux/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

**That is it.** When installation finishes, open **VFang** from your app menu.

Run the command as your normal user—do not add `sudo`. Enter your password only
when the installer asks. If it says group access was added, log out and back in
once, then open **VFang**.

The installer chooses the correct packages for your Linux system, checks them,
installs the app and background service together, upgrades an existing VFang
installation safely, and refuses downgrades.

## What VFang can do

- 🎛️ **Performance modes:** Silent, Balanced, Gaming, and Custom CPU/GPU power.
- 🌀 **Fan control:** Automatic, fixed RPM, or your own fan curve.
- 🔌 **Power automation:** Change performance and fan settings when you plug in
  or unplug the charger.
- 🔋 **Battery care:** Limit charging to 50–80% on supported models.
- 🌈 **Lighting:** Control keyboard brightness/effects and the lid logo.
- 🎮 **GPU mode:** Switch between integrated, hybrid, and dedicated graphics.
- 🖥️ **Displays:** Change refresh rate, brightness, and supported external
  monitor color settings.
- 📊 **Live dashboard:** See temperatures, power use, fan speed, and a
  90-second history.
- 🔁 **Tray and autostart:** Quickly switch modes and restore settings after
  reboot or sleep.

VFang focuses on **Razer Blade laptops**. It does not currently remap
mice/keyboards or create macros, so it is not a complete Razer Synapse
replacement for every Razer device.

## Will it work on my laptop?

VFang recognizes **48 Razer Blade models from 2015–2025**. Each known model has
its own safe fan limits and feature list.

Tested x86_64 Linux bases:

- Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, and 26.04
- Debian 12 and 13
- Fedora 43 and 44
- Arch Linux and CachyOS

Linux Mint, Zorin OS, Pop!_OS, and other derivatives are accepted when they
report one of the supported Ubuntu, Debian, or Fedora bases. Other Arch
derivatives are accepted when `/etc/os-release` contains the exact
`ID_LIKE=arch` family token. The installer warns that compatible derivatives
are not tested directly. Other CPU architectures and unsupported base releases
are rejected before anything is installed.

Unknown Razer product IDs are monitor-only by default. Check the
[full model list](crates/fang-protocol/src/models.rs) or follow
[the hardware testing guide](HARDWARE_TESTING.md) when adding a model.

## Safety

VFang controls the laptop's embedded controller directly, but hardware-changing
features have guardrails:

- Fan speeds and curves are kept inside the limits for your model.
- A guard that cannot be disabled forces maximum fans at CPU **95 °C** or GPU
  **87 °C**. Missing or stale CPU temperature data also forces maximum fans.
- Stopping the background service restores the laptop's automatic fan control.
- App/daemon version mismatches allow status viewing but block hardware changes.
- Custom CPU **Boost** means more heat and fan noise.

The laptop's own thermal protections continue to work as an additional safety
layer.

## More install options

<details>
<summary><strong>Check the installer before running it</strong></summary>

```bash
curl -fLO https://github.com/bladeandsoulx/vfang-razer-linux/releases/latest/download/install.sh
less install.sh
bash install.sh
```

This lets you read the script before it asks for administrator access.

For an extra integrity check, download the installer and checksum manifest from
the pinned v0.9.9 release:

```bash
curl -fLO 'https://github.com/bladeandsoulx/vfang-razer-linux/releases/download/v0.9.9/{install.sh,SHA256SUMS}'
grep '  install.sh$' SHA256SUMS > install.sh.sha256
sha256sum --check install.sh.sha256
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install release packages manually</strong></summary>

Download both packages from the same release, then install them together:

```bash
# Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt install ./fangd_0.9.9-1_amd64.deb ./Fang_0.9.9_amd64.deb

# Fedora 43 or 44
sudo dnf install ./fangd-0.9.9-1.x86_64.rpm ./fang-0.9.9-1.x86_64.rpm
```

On Arch Linux, CachyOS, or a compatible Arch derivative, first fully update
with `sudo pacman -Syu`. Reboot before installing VFang if that update requests
it, then install the release pair:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./fangd-0.9.9-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst \
  ./fang-0.9.9-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

Enable the background service and give your user access:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now fangd
sudo usermod -aG fang "$USER"
```

Log out and back in once after adding the group. To remove VFang, use the
matching package-family command: `sudo apt remove fang fangd`,
`sudo dnf remove fang fangd`, or `sudo pacman -Rns fang fangd`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source on Ubuntu or Debian</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bladeandsoulx/vfang-razer-linux
cd vfang-razer-linux
sudo ./packaging/install-from-source.sh
```

The script installs the build tools, builds and installs VFang, starts its
background service, and gives your user access.

</details>

## Development

You can develop VFang on any OS without Razer hardware.

```bash
# Terminal 1: run the daemon with simulated hardware
cargo run -p fangd -- --mock --tcp 127.0.0.1:7331

# Terminal 2: run the desktop app
cd app
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

For the browser-only UI simulator:

```bash
cd app
npm run dev
```

Run the Rust tests with `cargo test --workspace`. See
[`app/scripts/version.mjs`](app/scripts/version.mjs) for release version
management.

Real hardware control uses the protected `/run/fangd.sock` Unix socket. TCP is
available only with simulated hardware on a numeric loopback address.
